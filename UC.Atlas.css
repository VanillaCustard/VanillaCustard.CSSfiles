He remembers his storied history, and never seems to forget it (though he does wonder how much of it is memory and how much is warped dreams...). Well before current time, Atlas was born in a land that had no name, but was rife with magic. Beings born there almost always had some sort of arcane ability imbued within them, and Atlas was no different. As a young colt, he found he would have intensely vivid dreams when he slept, where he would see and experience the dreamscape through the eyes and senses of an animal he couldn't possibly know that much about. First it was a bird, of some sort, then a wolf, then stags, and wildcats ... As he aged, Atlas came to realize that these weren't dreams, but experiences. His training as a young warg began. There was one other in his tribe with that ability, and so Atlas spent many years studying beneath his better. By the time the Darkness came and devoured everything there was of the Land With No Name, he could take the mind of any single animal he wished to at will. But like the rest of the tribe, he fled the Darkness. Separated from his people and his parents, it began a long journey that the young stallion took by himself. He flitted from this world to that one on sunset colored wings, eventually meeting his first love, Alena. She rooted him, for she could not fly, and bore him a daughter the very next spring. Wolves took his daughter, Eris, just a few short weeks later. Alena grieved hard, grew thin despite Atlas's urging and comfort, and passed in the fall. Atlas had no choice but to move on. Broken hearted, stricken by the cruelty of the world he lived in, he wandered at random with no particular destination through winter, weakening steadily. Unfortunately, his immortality kept him from the death he yearned for so deeply. Over the next ninety years, Atlas loved more, but he always fell for mortals. Eventually, the stallion could not take it anymore, and promised himself he would never love someone he would outlive ever again. He walled his heart away and wandered like a vagabond, looking for people that were like him, eventually waking up in Uncharted Lands.
